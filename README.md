# Introduction 
Neural Image Enhancer is a Neural Network model that takes an RGB image as an input, and predicts informations such as depth, volume or distance.
The idea is to use this model to calculate the volume of an empty space in a box. It is useful because then boxes can be reduced or filled with more content such as adding material if it is needed.
    

# Getting Started
 Guide :
1.	Installation process
